# Browser KMS Enclave - Implementation Plan

**Status**: üöß STUB - Awaiting Target State
**Dependencies**: target-state.md (incomplete)

## Purpose

This document defines the phased implementation roadmap for the verifiable KMS enclave, breaking down the work into manageable milestones with clear deliverables and success criteria.

## Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**CRITICAL**: This project MUST follow strict Test-Driven Development practices with **100% code coverage** from the very beginning.

### TDD Requirements

**Every feature, from Phase 0 onwards, must**:
1. **Write tests first** - Before writing any production code
2. **Red-Green-Refactor** - Follow the TDD cycle:
   - Write a failing test (RED)
   - Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
   - Refactor while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
3. **100% coverage** - No exceptions, no compromises
4. **Test all paths** - Success paths, error paths, edge cases
5. **No untested code** - Code without tests must not be merged

### Why 100% Coverage is Critical

For a security-critical cryptographic system:
- **Cryptographic correctness** - Every crypto operation must be verified
- **Error handling** - All failure modes must be tested
- **Security guarantees** - Isolation boundaries must be validated
- **Regression prevention** - Changes cannot break existing guarantees
- **Auditability** - Tests serve as executable documentation

### TDD Applies To

- ‚úÖ Crypto operations (key generation, signing, verification)
- ‚úÖ RPC protocol (message handling, serialization)
- ‚úÖ Error handling (all error paths)
- ‚úÖ Browser API interactions (WebCrypto, IndexedDB, postMessage)
- ‚úÖ Build scripts (determinism, hash generation)
- ‚úÖ Verification tools (hash checking, signature validation)

### Measurement and Enforcement

**Coverage tooling**:
- Use `c8` or similar for coverage measurement
- Set coverage thresholds in `package.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "c8": {
      "all": true,
      "lines": 100,
      "functions": 100,
      "branches": 100,
      "statements": 100
    }
  }
  ```

**CI/CD enforcement**:
- Coverage checks run on every commit
- PRs cannot be merged if coverage drops below 100%
- Build fails if any code is untested

**Code review**:
- Tests reviewed before implementation code
- Test quality is as important as implementation quality
- Reviewers verify TDD process was followed

### Pre-Commit Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Before attempting any commit, all quality checks MUST pass without errors.

**Recommended: Use the Makefile**
```bash
make pre-commit   # Runs test-coverage, typecheck, and lint in sequence
```

**Manual execution** (if needed):
```bash
pnpm test:coverage # All tests must pass with 100% coverage
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript must compile without errors
pnpm lint          # ESLint must pass without errors
```

**Coverage Requirement**:
- 100% code coverage is MANDATORY for all commits
- Coverage is enforced via `pnpm test:coverage` (which runs `vitest run --coverage`)
- Coverage must be 100% for: lines, branches, functions, and statements
- Use `/* c8 ignore next */` only for defensive code that cannot be tested

**Commit workflow**:
1. Write/modify code following TDD
2. Run: `make pre-commit`
3. Fix any errors
4. Only then attempt `git commit`

**Rationale**:
- Prevents broken code from entering version control
- Ensures consistent code quality
- Catches type errors and linting issues early
- Maintains 100% test coverage requirement
- Makes code review faster and more focused

**Note**: These checks are also enforced in CI, but running them locally before commit saves time and prevents failed CI builds.

### Commit Message Guidelines

**Commit messages should be comprehensive and well-structured.**

**Format**:
```
<type>: <short summary> (50 chars or less)

<detailed description explaining what and why>

- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

<optional footer with references, breaking changes, etc.>
```

**Types**:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring without behavior change
- `chore:` - Build process, dependencies, tooling
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

**Best Practices**:

1. **Write comprehensive messages**
   - Explain WHAT changed and WHY
   - Include context for future developers
   - Reference related issues or decisions
   - Don't just repeat the code diff

2. **Group related files appropriately**
   - **Together**: Files that implement a single feature/fix
   - **Together**: Tests and their implementation
   - **Together**: Documentation updates with code changes
   - **Separate**: Unrelated changes (e.g., separate features)
   - **Separate**: Refactoring from new features

3. **When to group files**:
   - ‚úÖ Test file + implementation file for same feature
   - ‚úÖ Multiple files that together implement one feature
   - ‚úÖ Configuration file + code that uses it
   - ‚úÖ Documentation + code it documents
   - ‚ùå Two unrelated bug fixes
   - ‚ùå New feature + refactoring of old code

**Examples**:

**Good commit message** (grouped appropriately):
```
feat: Add VAPID key generation to KMS worker

Implement P-256 ECDSA key generation with non-extractable private keys
for VAPID authentication. This is Phase 0 of the KMS implementation.

- Add generateVAPIDKeypair() function in worker.ts
- Add comprehensive tests for key generation and signing
- Add RPC protocol tests for key generation method
- Document DER vs P-1363 signature format differences

Tests include verification of:
- Non-extractable private keys
- Correct algorithm parameters (P-256, ES256)
- Signature generation and verification
- Performance requirements (<100ms key gen)

Phase 0 deliverable: Proof of concept for browser crypto operations
```

**Bad commit message** (too brief):
```
fix stuff
```

**Good file grouping**:
- Commit 1: `worker.ts` + `worker.test.ts` (feature + tests)
- Commit 2: `rpc.ts` + `rpc.test.ts` (related feature + tests)

**Bad file grouping**:
- Commit 1: `worker.ts` + `rpc.ts` + `storage.ts` (unrelated features)
- Commit 2: All tests together separately from implementation

**Atomic Commits**:
- Each commit should be a complete, working change
- All tests should pass at every commit
- If reverting is needed, revert should be clean
- Makes git bisect and code review easier

### Testing Strategy

**CRITICAL**: All testing follows strict TDD principles with 100% coverage requirement.

#### Test-Driven Development Process

**For every feature**:
1. **Write failing test** - Define expected behavior through tests
2. **Run test** - Verify it fails (RED)
3. **Write minimal code** - Just enough to pass the test
4. **Run test** - Verify it passes (GREEN)
5. **Refactor** - Improve code while keeping tests green
6. **Verify coverage** - Ensure 100% coverage maintained

#### Unit Tests (Test First, Always)

**Crypto Operations** (All must have 100% coverage):
- Key generation (ECDSA P-256, Ed25519, X25519)
- Signing operations (JWT, arbitrary data)
- Signature verification
- Key export/import (where applicable)
- DER ‚Üî P-1363 conversion
- Raw public key extraction
- JWK thumbprint calculation

**RPC Protocol**:
- Message serialization/deserialization
- Request/response pairing
- Timeout handling
- Error propagation
- Origin validation

**Error Handling** (Critical - must test all paths):
- Invalid input handling
- Browser API failures (WebCrypto, IndexedDB)
- Timeout scenarios
- Memory/quota limits
- Concurrent operation handling

**Storage**:
- IndexedDB operations
- Key persistence and retrieval
- Non-extractable key verification
- Storage quota handling

#### Integration Tests (Test First)

**Cross-Component Communication**:

- Fail if any test fails
- Block merge if tests don't pass

**Coverage reporting**:
- Display coverage in PR comments
- Track coverage trends over time
- Alert on coverage decreases
- Require maintainer override for any coverage drop

### Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1: Development** (Internal Only)
- Deploy to dev environment
- Test with development PWA
- Validate all functionality
- Measure performance

**Phase 2: Staging** (Limited Testing)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Beta testers validate enclave
- Community review of source code
- Security audit (if budget allows)

**Phase 3: Production** (Gradual Rollout)
- Feature flag: `USE_VERIFIABLE_KMS=true`
- Rollout to 1% of users
- Monitor for errors and performance issues
- Gradually increase to 100%

**Phase 4: Mandatory** (Full Adoption)
- Remove feature flag
- All users use verifiable KMS
- Deprecate legacy key management (if any)
